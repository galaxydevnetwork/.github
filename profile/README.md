## What is this?
GalaxyDevNetwork is a Multiverses with Universes that have Galaxies, let's say meme20200, the popular universe in GalaxyDevNetwork is meme20200,
meme20200 has Galaxies like `meme20200 Wiki`, `meme20200 Teams`, some Universes do not have Galaxies like GalaxyDev.

## Are these Universes & Galaxies real in Real Life?
Nope I wish they were real Universes & Galaxies but no they are just other names to replace the boring child and parents and make it more Space-themed
